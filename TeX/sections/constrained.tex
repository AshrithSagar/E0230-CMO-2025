\section{Separating hyperplane theorem}

\begin{theorem}{Separating hyperplane theorem}{separating-hyperplane-theorem}
    Let \( C, D \subseteq \R^n \) be non-empty, disjoint, closed, convex sets.
    If one of the sets is compact, then there exists a hyperplane that separates them.
    That is, there exists \( \b \in \R^n \setminus \set{\zero}, \; c \in \R \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dotp{\b}{\x}
        \leq c
        <
        \dotp{\b}{\y},
        \quad
        \forall \x \in C,
        \; \forall \y \in D
    \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Since one of the sets is compact, there exists \( \x_0 \in C, \; \y_0 \in D \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \norm{\x_0 - \y_0}
        =
        \min_{\x \in C, \, \y \in D} \norm{\x - \y}
        >
        0
    \end{equation*}
    Let \( \b = \y_0 - \x_0, \; c = \dotp{\b}{\pbrac{\x_0 + \y_0}/2} \).
    We will show that this hyperplane separates \( C, D \).

    Suppose there exists \( \x' \in C \) such that \( \dotp{\b}{\x'} > c \).
    Then,
    \begin{align*}
        &
        0
        <
        2\dotp{\b}{\x' - (\x_0 + \y_0)/2}
        =
        2\dotp{\b}{\pbrac{\x' - \x_0}/2} - 2\dotp{\b}{\pbrac{\y_0 - \x_0}/2}
        =
        2\dotp{\b}{\pbrac{\x' - \x_0}/2} - \norm{\b}^2
        \\
        \implies
        &
        4 \norm{\b}^2 \norm{\pbrac{\x' - \x_0}/2}^2
        >
        4 \norm{\b}^2 \dotp{\b}{\pbrac{\x' - \x_0}/2}
        >
        4 \norm{\b}^4
        \\ &
        4 \norm{\pbrac{\x' - \x_0}/2}^2
        >
        4 \norm{\b}^2
        =
        4 \norm{\y_0 - \x_0}^2
    \end{align*}
    This is a contradiction since \( \x', \x_0 \in C, \; \y_0 \in D \) and \( C, D \) are disjoint.
    Thus, \( \dotp{\b}{\x} \leq c, \; \forall \x \in C \).
\end{proof}

\section{Farkas' lemma}

\begin{theorem}{Farkas' lemma}{}
    For \( \A \in \R^{m \times n}, \, \b \in \R^m \), exactly one of the following statements is true:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( \exists \x \in \R^n \text{ such that } \A \x = \b \text{ and } \x \geq 0 \).

        \item \( \exists \y \in \R^m \text{ such that } \dotp{\A}{\y} \geq 0 \text{ and } \dotp{\b}{\y} < 0 \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose both statements are true.
    Then, we have a contradiction since this implies
    \begin{equation*}
        \dotp{\b}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\pbrac{\A \x}}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\x}{\dotp{\A}{\y}} \geq 0
    \end{equation*}

    Now, suppose the first statement is false.
    Then, consider the closed convex cone \( \func{C}{\A} \triangleq \set{\A \x \given \x \geq 0} \), which does not contain \( \b \).
    By the separating hyperplane theorem~\pthmref{thm:separating-hyperplane-theorem}, there exists a hyperplane that separates \( \func{C}{\A} \) and \( \b \).
    Thus, there exists \( \y \in \R^m, \; c \in \R \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dotp{\pbrac{\A \x}}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\x}{\dotp{\A}{\y}}
        \geq c
        > \dotp{\b}{\y},
        \quad \forall \x \geq 0
    \end{equation*}
    Since this holds \( \forall \x \geq 0, \; c > 0, \) we must have \( \dotp{\A}{\y} \geq 0 \),
    Thus, the second statement is true.
\end{proof}
