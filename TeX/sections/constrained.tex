\section{Farkas' lemma}

\begin{theorem}{Farkas' lemma}{}
    For \( \A \in \R^{m \times n}, \, \b \in \R^m \), exactly one of the following statements is true:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \( \exists \x \in \R^n \text{ such that } \A \x = \b \text{ and } \x \geq 0 \).

        \item \( \exists \y \in \R^m \text{ such that } \dotp{\A}{\y} \geq 0 \text{ and } \dotp{\b}{\y} < 0 \).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Suppose both statements are true.
    Then, we have a contradiction since this implies
    \begin{equation*}
        \dotp{\b}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\pbrac{\A \x}}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\x}{\dotp{\A}{\y}} \geq 0
    \end{equation*}

    Now, suppose the first statement is false.
    Then, consider the closed convex cone \( \func{C}{\A} \triangleq \set{\A \x \given \x \geq 0} \), which does not contain \( \b \).
    By the separating hyperplane theorem, there exists a hyperplane that separates \( \func{C}{\A} \) and \( \b \).
    Thus, there exists \( \y \in \R^m, \; c \in \R \) such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dotp{\pbrac{\A \x}}{\y}
        =
        \dotp{\x}{\dotp{\A}{\y}}
        \geq c
        > \dotp{\b}{\y},
        \quad \forall \x \geq 0
    \end{equation*}
    Since this holds \( \forall \x \geq 0, \; c > 0, \) we must have \( \dotp{\A}{\y} \geq 0 \),
    Thus, the second statement is true.
\end{proof}
