\section*{Question 9}

Suppose we have positive definite \( A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \), and linearly independent vectors \( \left\{v_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{m} \), where \( m<n \).
How would you convert the problem
\begin{equation*}
  \underset{x}{\argmin} x^{\top} A x \text { such that } x \in \operatorname{span}\left(v_{1}, \ldots, v_{m}\right)
\end{equation*}
into an unconstrained problem?
Does this problem have a unique solution?
If so, under what conditions would this problem not have a unique solution?
