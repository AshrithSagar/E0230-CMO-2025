\section*{Question 3: When Newton Fails}

Consider the function

\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = |x| + x^{2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why Newton's method cannot be directly applied at \( x = 0 \).

    \item Starting from \( x_{0} = 1 \), compute one step of Newton's method (using \( f^{\prime}(x) \) and \( f^{\prime \prime}(x) \) wherever they exist).

    \item What happens if you start from \( x_{0} = -1 \) instead?

    \item What does this example illustrate about the limitations of Newton's method when the function is not twice differentiable?
\end{enumerate}
