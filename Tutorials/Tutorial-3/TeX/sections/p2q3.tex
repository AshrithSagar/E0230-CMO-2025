\section*{Question 3: When Newton Fails}

Consider the function

\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = |x| + x^{2}
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explain why Newton's method cannot be directly applied at \( x = 0 \).

    \item Starting from \( x_{0} = 1 \), compute one step of Newton's method (using \( f^{\prime}(x) \) and \( f^{\prime \prime}(x) \) wherever they exist).

    \item What happens if you start from \( x_{0} = -1 \) instead?

    \item What does this example illustrate about the limitations of Newton's method when the function is not twice differentiable?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{equation*}
    \implies
    f(x) =
    \begin{cases}
        x^2 + x, & x \geq 0 \\
        x^2 - x, & x < 0
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{(1) Newton's method at \( x = 0 \)}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{align*}
    \implies
    f'(x)
    & =
    \begin{cases}
        2x + 1, & x > 0 \\
        2x - 1, & x < 0
    \end{cases}
    \\
    f''(x)
    & =
    2,
    \quad x \neq 0
\end{align*}

At \( x = 0 \), \( f'(x) \) is \underline{not defined}, hence Newton's method cannot be directly applied at \( x = 0 \).

\subsection*{(2) Newton's method, \( x_0 = 1 \)}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{align*}
    \implies
    x_1
    & =
    x_0 - \frac{f'(x_0)}{f''(x_0)}
    =
    1 - \frac{3}{2}
    \implies
    \boxed{
        x_1
        =
        -\half
    }
    < 0
\end{align*}

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection*{(3) Newton's method, \( x_0 = -1 \)}

\vspace{-1em}
\begin{align*}
    \implies
    x_1
    & =
    x_0 - \frac{f'(x_0)}{f''(x_0)}
    =
    -1 - \frac{-3}{2}
    \implies
    \boxed{
        x_1
        =
        \half
    }
    > 0
\end{align*}

\subsection*{(4) Limitations of Newton's method}

This example exhibits \underline{oscillatory behavior} when applying Newton's method starting from different initial points.
As can be seen from the iterates, starting with \( x_0 = 1 \) leads to \( x_1 = -\half \), and starting with \( x_0 = -1 \) leads to \( x_1 = \half \).
This oscillation occurs because the function \( f(x) \) is not twice differentiable at \( x = 0 \), where the derivative \( f'(x) \) is discontinuous.
