\section*{Question 1: Local vs Global Convergence}

Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = x^{3}-2 x+2
\end{equation*}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write down \( f^{\prime}(x) \) and \( f^{\prime \prime}(x) \).

    \item Apply Newton's method starting from \( x_{0} = 0 \) and compute the first two iterates.

    \item Repeat starting from \( x_{0} = -2 \).

    \item Compare the two behaviours.
        Why does Newton's method converge rapidly in one case but not in the other?
        What does this illustrate about the importance of the starting point?
\end{enumerate}
