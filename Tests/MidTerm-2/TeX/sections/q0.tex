In the following, let \( \I = \bbrac{\e_1, \ldots, \e_d} \) be a \( d \times d \) matrix with \( e_{j} \) be the \( j \) th column.
Also \( \x = \bbrac{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_d}^\top \in \R^d \) and \( \|\x\| = \sqrt{{\x}^\top \x} \).
Set of real symmetric \( d \times d \) matrices will be denoted by \( \SD \), the set of positive semidefinite matrices will be denoted by \( \PSD \), and the set of positive definite matrices will be denoted by \( \PD \).
\( [n] \) will denote the set \( \{1,2, \ldots, n\} \).
\begin{equation*}
    \min _{\x \in \R^d} f(\x)
    \quad
    f(\x) = \half {\x}^\top Q \x+h^\top \x+c
    \tag{\texttt{CQ}}
\end{equation*}
where \( Q \in \PSD, h \in \R^d, c \in \R \).
